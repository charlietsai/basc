BASC is split into four steps:

  1. Generate an empty, relaxed surface
  2. Fit the length scales for the GP
  3. Obtain training data for accelerated DFT calculations (optional)
  4. Run the bayesian optimization

In general, step 1 is the slowest, because it requires performing a full
relaxation with DFT and BFGS (appx 40 calculations).  Step 2 is quick since
we can use a Lennard-Jones potential.  Step 3 is required to use the
"GPAWTrained" calculator for accelerated DFT calculations; it requires
several (at least 5) full DFT calculations.  Step 4 is the actual
optimization step; it is reasonably quick if using GPAWTrained, and somewhat
slower if using a normal DFT calculator (at least 50-100 calculations,
depending on the characteristics and dimensionality of the system).

You should use the procedure with four standalone steps if you intend to run
BASC multiple times on the same surface (e.g., to tune the BASC parameters or
run BASC with multiple different adsorbate molecules).  However, you can run
them in sequence in a single job if you want a quick start black box.
